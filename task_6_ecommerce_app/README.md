# 🛒 Task6 eCommerce App – Flutter + Firebase

A functional **E-Commerce mobile application** built with **Flutter** and **Firebase**.  
This app includes **Buyer** and **Seller** modules with implemented core functionality, forming a strong base to expand into a fully featured marketplace.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was created as part of my **fellowship program** and served as a **trial project** during my job application process.  
It demonstrates my ability to design **multi-role systems**, integrate **Firebase services**, and deliver a working product with structured UI and real-time backend connectivity.
