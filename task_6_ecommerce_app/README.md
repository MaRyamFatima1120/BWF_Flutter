# 🛒 task6_ecommerce_app

This project was developed as part of my **fellowship program** and served as a **trial project** while applying for jobs.  
The purpose of making this app was to **demonstrate my skills in Flutter and Firebase** by building a functional eCommerce application that covers both **buyer** and **seller** functionalities, while still being a work in progress for UI design.
