# task6_ecommerce_app
This project is a part of my fellowship and serves as a starting point for building an eCommerce application using Flutter and Firebase. While the UI design is still a work in progress, the core functionality of buyer and seller modules has been implemented, providing a solid foundation to build upon.

#Features
Buyer Module: Browse products, add items to the cart, and proceed to checkout.
Seller Module: Manage product listings and track orders.
